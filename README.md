### Bio

I am currently a Statistician working in Market Research with a background of studying Statistics upto masters. I have been involved in projects such as; analysis of household survey data in Somalia, looking at simulating land degradation in Somalia and I am currently involved part time in using Statistical simulation and data analysis to feed information to a decentralised oracle in the blockchain area.

I graduated from Queen Mary University of London with a BSc Mathematics and Statistics. I then followed this up with an MSc Statistics from University College London. Apart from my contracted projects - I work full time as a Statistician in consumer research deriving insights from primary survey data for multinational companies. I use SPSS, R and Excel regularly for data manipulation and checks, statistical modelling and visualisation and reporting.
